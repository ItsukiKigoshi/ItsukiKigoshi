## Hi there 👋
I'm NOT an engineer but wanna be a creator/artist.

### 🔭I’m currently thinking of creating...
- [Shinonome Bunko](https://github.com/ItsukiKigoshi/shinonome-bunko): Automated git-based OCR&peer-review platform for publishing public domain Japanese literature as e-books.
- [Curhythm](https://github.com/ItsukiKigoshi/curhythm): Rubik's Cube-alike musical instrument to generate beat, melody, harmony & video.
- [ICU Catalogue](https://github.com/ItsukiKigoshi/icu-catalogue): Powerful syllabi search engine and academic planning tool for ICU students.
- OpenPoliCash: Git-based open-source 政治資金収支報告書 database with an Open Data
- open-desk-view: Open-sourced webcam tool for showing docs on ur table with ease.
 
### 🎈My dream is...
  - Collaborating with [Zutomayo](https://zutomayo.net) as an artist🦔.
  - Holding a museum exhibition as a contemporary artist🎨.
